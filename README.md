# geo_popn_density

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geo_popn_density is to analyse the population densities for
selected countries - currently only Australia.

## Installation

Just clone and go from GitHub.

## Australian Data

Data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Population data
sourced at the Statistical Area 2 level. See references below for
further detail on Australian statistical geographic standards. Density
is given by the ABS but is recalculated here as the
population-area-density numbers do not line up as given. Data is output
to `au.csv` in the data directory.
