# geo_popn_density

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geo_popn_density is to find the population densities for selected
countries.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geo_popn_density like so:

``` r
This is a simple script, so just download from GitHub...hopefully!
```

## Australian Data
Data sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Population data sourced
at the Statistical Area 2 level. See references below for further detail on
Australian statistical geographic standards. Density is given by the ABS but
is recalculated here as the population-area-density numbers do not line up as
given. Data is output to `au.csv` in the data directory.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(geo_popn_density)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
