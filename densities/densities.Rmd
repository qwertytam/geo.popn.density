This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)

all_countries <- GetAllData()

avgw_densities <- CalcAvgWDensities(all_countries)

allc_by_density <- AllDataDscDensity(all_countries)

mdn_sa <- FindMedianSAbyDensity(allc_by_density)

msas <- GroupbyMSA(all_countries)

msas_by_popn <- ArrangeMSAsbyPopn(msas)

msas_by_density <- ArrangeMSAsbyDensity(msas)

mdn_msa <- FindMedianMSAbyPopulation(msas_by_popn)

mdn_msa_occurence <- FindMedianMSAOccurencebyDensity(msas_by_density)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
PlotAvgWDensities(avgw_densities)
PlotAllDataByDensity(allc_by_density)

```
